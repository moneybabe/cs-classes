BSTMap, TreeMap, and HashMap are significantly faster than ULLMap. For example, with 30000 elements of 20-length string, ULLMap takes 5sec while BSTMap takes 0.03, TreeMap takes 0.02, and HashMap takes 0.02.

For now, BSTMap, TreeMap, and Hashmap have very close performance. I expecte if large enough sample size, and that ULLMap is removed so we can run the experiements without waiting for ULLMap, HashMap would be fastest, then TreeMap (since it's optimized), and lastly our homemade BSTMap.
